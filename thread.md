# Threading in Python: A Detailed Explanation

Threading allows Python to run multiple threads concurrently within a single process, ideal for I/O-bound tasks but limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for CPU-bound operations.

## How It Works

### **1. Thread Creation**

Threads are lightweight execution units that share the same memory space:

```python
import threading

def worker(name):
    print(f"Thread {name} running")

# Method 1: Using Thread class
t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=('A',))
t.start()
t.join()

# Method 2: Subclassing Thread
class WorkerThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
    
    def run(self):
        print(f"Thread {self.name} running")

t = WorkerThread('B')
t.start()
t.join()
```

**What happens internally:**
- The OS creates a new thread within the same process
- All threads share the same memory space and resources
- Threads are scheduled by the OS, but only one executes Python bytecode at a time (GIL)

### **2. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**

The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously.

**Key Points:**
- Only one thread executes Python code at a time
- GIL is released during I/O operations (file, network, sleep)
- CPU-bound tasks don't benefit from threading
- I/O-bound tasks benefit significantly

```python
import threading
import time

# CPU-bound (doesn't benefit from threading due to GIL)
def cpu_bound():
    count = 0
    for i in range(10_000_000):
        count += i

# I/O-bound (benefits from threading - GIL released during I/O)
def io_bound():
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulates I/O operation
```

### **3. Memory Model**

All threads in a process share:
- **Global variables**: Accessible and modifiable by all threads
- **Heap memory**: Objects created in one thread are visible to others
- **File descriptors**: Open files, sockets, etc.

Each thread has its own:
- **Call stack**: Local variables and function calls
- **Program counter**: Current execution position
- **Register state**: CPU registers

```python
# Shared memory example
counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        counter += 1

t1 = threading.Thread(target=increment)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=increment)
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()

print(counter)  # Likely NOT 200000 due to race condition!
```

### **4. Thread Synchronization**

#### **Lock (Mutex)**

Prevents multiple threads from accessing shared resources simultaneously:

```python
import threading

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def safe_increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        lock.acquire()
        try:
            counter += 1
        finally:
            lock.release()

# Better: use context manager
def safe_increment_v2():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        with lock:
            counter += 1

t1 = threading.Thread(target=safe_increment_v2)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=safe_increment_v2)
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
print(counter)  # Now correctly 200000
```

#### **RLock (Reentrant Lock)**

Can be acquired multiple times by the same thread:

```python
import threading

rlock = threading.RLock()

def recursive_function(n):
    with rlock:
        if n > 0:
            print(n)
            recursive_function(n - 1)

t = threading.Thread(target=recursive_function, args=(3,))
t.start()
t.join()
```

#### **Semaphore**

Limits the number of threads accessing a resource:

```python
import threading
import time

# Allow max 3 threads to access resource simultaneously
semaphore = threading.Semaphore(3)

def access_resource(thread_num):
    with semaphore:
        print(f"Thread {thread_num} accessing resource")
        time.sleep(2)
        print(f"Thread {thread_num} done")

threads = [threading.Thread(target=access_resource, args=(i,)) for i in range(10)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

#### **Event**

Allows threads to wait for a signal:

```python
import threading
import time

event = threading.Event()

def waiter():
    print("Waiting for event...")
    event.wait()  # Blocks until event is set
    print("Event received!")

def setter():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Setting event...")
    event.set()

t1 = threading.Thread(target=waiter)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=setter)
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
```

#### **Condition**

Advanced synchronization - allows threads to wait for specific conditions:

```python
import threading
import time

condition = threading.Condition()
items = []

def consumer():
    with condition:
        while not items:
            print("Consumer waiting...")
            condition.wait()  # Release lock and wait
        item = items.pop(0)
        print(f"Consumed: {item}")

def producer():
    time.sleep(1)
    with condition:
        items.append("item")
        print("Produced item")
        condition.notify()  # Wake up one waiting thread

t1 = threading.Thread(target=consumer)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=producer)
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
```

#### **Barrier**

Synchronizes multiple threads at a specific point:

```python
import threading
import time
import random

barrier = threading.Barrier(3)

def worker(num):
    time.sleep(random.random())
    print(f"Thread {num} reached barrier")
    barrier.wait()  # Wait for all threads
    print(f"Thread {num} passed barrier")

threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,)) for i in range(3)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

### **5. Thread Communication**

#### **Queue (Thread-Safe)**

```python
import threading
import queue
import time

q = queue.Queue()

def producer():
    for i in range(5):
        q.put(f"item_{i}")
        print(f"Produced: item_{i}")
        time.sleep(0.5)
    q.put(None)  # Sentinel to signal completion

def consumer():
    while True:
        item = q.get()
        if item is None:
            break
        print(f"Consumed: {item}")
        q.task_done()

t1 = threading.Thread(target=producer)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=consumer)
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
```

**Queue Types:**
- `Queue()`: FIFO queue
- `LifoQueue()`: LIFO (stack) queue
- `PriorityQueue()`: Items retrieved by priority

### **6. Thread Lifecycle**

```python
import threading

t = threading.Thread(target=function)

# Thread states and methods
t.start()           # Start the thread
t.is_alive()        # Check if thread is running
t.join()            # Wait for thread to complete
t.join(timeout=5)   # Wait max 5 seconds
t.name              # Thread name
t.ident             # Thread identifier
t.daemon = True     # Set as daemon thread (dies with main thread)

# Current thread info
threading.current_thread()      # Get current thread object
threading.active_count()        # Number of active threads
threading.enumerate()           # List of all active threads
```

### **7. Thread Pool (concurrent.futures)**

Better way to manage multiple threads:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import time

def task(n):
    time.sleep(1)
    return n * n

# Method 1: map
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    results = executor.map(task, range(10))
    print(list(results))

# Method 2: submit (more flexible)
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(task, i) for i in range(10)]
    for future in futures:
        print(future.result())  # Blocks until result ready

# Method 3: as_completed (process results as they arrive)
from concurrent.futures import as_completed

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(task, i) for i in range(10)]
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        print(future.result())
```

### **8. Thread-Local Data**

Data that's unique to each thread:

```python
import threading

thread_local = threading.local()

def worker(value):
    thread_local.data = value
    print(f"Thread {threading.current_thread().name}: {thread_local.data}")

t1 = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=("A",))
t2 = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=("B",))
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
```

### **9. Daemon Threads**

Background threads that don't prevent program exit:

```python
import threading
import time

def daemon_worker():
    while True:
        print("Daemon working...")
        time.sleep(1)

def normal_worker():
    time.sleep(3)
    print("Normal thread done")

# Daemon thread
t1 = threading.Thread(target=daemon_worker, daemon=True)
t1.start()

# Normal thread
t2 = threading.Thread(target=normal_worker)
t2.start()

# Program exits after t2 completes, killing t1
t2.join()
```

### **10. Common Pitfalls**

#### **Race Conditions**

```python
# BAD: Race condition
counter = 0
def increment():
    global counter
    temp = counter
    temp += 1
    counter = temp

# GOOD: Use lock
lock = threading.Lock()
def safe_increment():
    global counter
    with lock:
        temp = counter
        temp += 1
        counter = temp
```

#### **Deadlock**

```python
# BAD: Potential deadlock
lock1 = threading.Lock()
lock2 = threading.Lock()

def thread1():
    with lock1:
        time.sleep(0.1)
        with lock2:
            pass

def thread2():
    with lock2:
        time.sleep(0.1)
        with lock1:
            pass

# GOOD: Always acquire locks in same order
def thread1_fixed():
    with lock1:
        with lock2:
            pass

def thread2_fixed():
    with lock1:
        with lock2:
            pass
```

### **11. Key Considerations**

**When to Use Threading:**
- I/O-bound operations (network requests, file operations)
- Concurrent API calls
- GUI applications (keeping UI responsive)
- Waiting for multiple events

**When NOT to Use Threading:**
- CPU-bound operations (use multiprocessing instead)
- When you need true parallelism
- Simple sequential tasks

**Performance Tips:**
- Thread creation has overhead (use thread pools)
- Too many threads can hurt performance (context switching)
- Keep critical sections small
- Avoid shared state when possible

**Best Practices:**
- Always use context managers (`with` statement) for locks
- Avoid global state
- Use queues for thread communication
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Handle exceptions in threads (they don't propagate)
- Use thread pools instead of creating threads manually

### **12. Exception Handling**

```python
import threading

def worker():
    try:
        raise ValueError("Error in thread")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception caught: {e}")

t = threading.Thread(target=worker)
t.start()
t.join()

# Or use threading.excepthook (Python 3.8+)
def custom_excepthook(args):
    print(f"Thread exception: {args.exc_value}")

threading.excepthook = custom_excepthook
```

Threading in Python is powerful for I/O-bound tasks but limited by the GIL for CPU-bound work. Understanding synchronization primitives and the GIL is crucial for writing correct concurrent programs.
